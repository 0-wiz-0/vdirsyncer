vdirsyncer synchronizes your calendars and addressbooks between two storages.
The supported storages are CalDAV, CardDAV, arbitrary HTTP resources, `vdir
<https://github.com/untitaker/vdir>`_ and :doc:`some more <storages>`.

It aims to be for CalDAV and CardDAV what `OfflineIMAP
<http://offlineimap.org/>`_ is for IMAP.
