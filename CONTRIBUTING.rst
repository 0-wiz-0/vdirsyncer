* If you're reporting an issue with vdirsyncer: You don't have to include
  every detail about your environment, but include your configuration, the
  commands you're executing (and their output). Also use ``--verbosity=DEBUG``
  when including output from vdirsyncer.

* If you're suggesting a feature, keep in mind that vdirsyncer tries not to
  be a calendar or contacts client, but rather just the piece of software that
  syncronizes all the data.
