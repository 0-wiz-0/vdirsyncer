* If you're reporting an issue with vdirsyncer:

  * Make sure you have the latest version by executing ``pip install --user
    --upgrade vdirsyncer``.

  * Include the Python version, your configuration, the commands you're
    executing, and their output.

  * Use ``--verbosity=DEBUG`` when including output from vdirsyncer.

* If you're suggesting a feature, keep in mind that vdirsyncer tries not to be
  a full calendar or contacts client, but rather just the piece of software
  that syncronizes all the data. If you're looking for a viewer for the
  calendar data you've synced, `khal <https://github.com/geier/khal>`_ is what
  you're looking for.
