# Specify a time range which should be syncronized. Either both start_date and
# end_date or neither have to be set. The default is to syncronize everything.
# The following example syncronizes from one year in the past to one year in
# the future.

# All Python expressions are allowed here. The global namespace contains
# everything from the datetime module. The expression has to evaluate to a
# datetime.
#start_date = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=365)

# Here, start_date is also in the namespace.
#end_date = datetime.now() + timedelta(days=365)
